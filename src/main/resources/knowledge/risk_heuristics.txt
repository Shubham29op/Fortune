RISK ASSESSMENT HEURISTICS & GUIDELINES

PORTFOLIO BETA INTERPRETATION:
- Beta < 0.8: CONSERVATIVE portfolio
  * Lower volatility, more stable returns
  * Suitable for risk-averse investors
  * May underperform in bull markets
  
- Beta 0.8 - 1.2: MODERATE portfolio
  * Balanced risk-return profile
  * Moves roughly with market average
  * Suitable for most investors
  
- Beta > 1.2: AGGRESSIVE portfolio
  * Higher volatility, potential for higher returns
  * More sensitive to market movements
  * Suitable for risk-tolerant investors

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC RISK WEIGHTS:
- COMMODITY: Weight 1.5 (highest volatility)
  * Gold, silver, oil are highly volatile
  * Commodity exposure > 30% increases portfolio risk significantly
  * Subject to supply/demand and geopolitical factors
  
- NSE (Equity): Weight 1.0 (market average)
  * Stock prices fluctuate with market sentiment
  * Individual stock risk can be high
  * Diversification across sectors reduces risk
  
- MF (Mutual Fund): Weight 0.7 (lower volatility)
  * Professionally managed, diversified by default
  * Lower volatility than individual stocks
  * Still subject to market risk

CONCENTRATION RISK THRESHOLDS:
- Single Asset > 20% of portfolio: HIGH concentration risk
- Single Category > 50% of portfolio: MODERATE concentration risk
- Single Sector > 40% of portfolio: MODERATE concentration risk
- Commodity > 30% of portfolio: HIGH volatility risk

VALUE AT RISK (VaR) INTERPRETATION:
- VaR at 95% confidence: 5% probability of loss exceeding calculated amount
- Example: VaR of $5,000 means 5% chance of losing more than $5,000 in one day
- Higher VaR = Higher risk
- VaR should be calculated using portfolio beta and total value

PERFORMANCE WARNING SIGNALS:
- Unrealized loss > 10%: Review positions, consider stop-loss
- Unrealized loss > 20%: Significant concern, may need rebalancing
- High volatility in unrealized P&L: Portfolio may be too aggressive
- Consistent underperformance vs. benchmark: Review asset selection

REBALANCING TRIGGERS:
- Category allocation drifts > 10% from target
- Single asset exceeds 20% of portfolio
- Portfolio beta shifts significantly (>0.2 change)
- Risk tolerance changes

RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
- Diversification: Spread investments across categories
- Regular rebalancing: Maintain target allocation
- Stop-loss orders: Limit downside risk
- Dollar-cost averaging: Reduce timing risk
- Asset allocation: Match risk tolerance
