CHART TYPES & THEIR MEANINGS:

LINE CHARTS:
- Purpose: Show trends over time
- Common Uses: Portfolio value, performance trends, price movements
- X-Axis: Typically time (dates, months, quarters)
- Y-Axis: Metric being tracked (value, percentage, price)
- Interpretation:
  * Upward slope: Positive trend, growth, gains
  * Downward slope: Negative trend, decline, losses
  * Flat line: Stable, no significant change
  * Sharp spikes: Volatility events, sudden changes
  * Gradual curves: Steady growth or decline
- Key Patterns:
  * Bullish trend: Consistent upward movement
  * Bearish trend: Consistent downward movement
  * Volatility: Frequent up/down movements
  * Consolidation: Sideways movement, range-bound

DOUGHNUT / PIE CHARTS:
- Purpose: Show allocation percentages, composition
- Common Uses: Asset allocation, category distribution, sector breakdown
- Interpretation:
  * Large segments: High concentration in that category
  * Small segments: Low exposure
  * Balanced chart: Even distribution across categories
  * Skewed chart: Concentration in one or few categories
- Risk Indicators:
  * Single segment > 50%: Concentration risk
  * Multiple small segments: Over-diversification
  * Balanced segments: Good diversification
- Color Coding:
  * Typically: Different colors for different categories
  * Hover: Shows exact percentage and value

BAR CHARTS:
- Purpose: Compare values across categories
- Common Uses: Performance comparison, exposure comparison, category analysis
- X-Axis: Categories or assets
- Y-Axis: Values being compared
- Interpretation:
  * Taller bars: Higher values, greater exposure
  * Shorter bars: Lower values, less exposure
  * Similar heights: Balanced distribution
  * One very tall bar: Outlier, concentration
- Comparison Use:
  * Compare across clients
  * Compare across time periods
  * Compare across categories

SCATTER PLOTS:
- Purpose: Show correlation between two metrics
- Common Uses: Risk vs. return analysis, correlation analysis
- X-Axis: One metric (e.g., risk, volatility)
- Y-Axis: Another metric (e.g., return, performance)
- Interpretation:
  * Clustered points: Similar risk/return profiles
  * Upward trend: Positive correlation
  * Downward trend: Negative correlation
  * Outliers: Assets with unusual characteristics

VISUALIZATION CONTEXT CLUES:

TIME RANGES:
- 1D (Daily): Short-term movements, intraday volatility
- 1W (Weekly): Short-term trends, weekly patterns
- 1M (Monthly): Medium-term trends, monthly performance
- 3M (Quarterly): Medium-term analysis, quarterly review
- 1Y (Yearly): Long-term trends, annual performance
- All Time: Historical perspective, long-term patterns

METRICS TO LOOK FOR:
- Total Value: Overall portfolio worth
- Percentage Change: Relative performance
- Absolute Change: Dollar amount change
- Beta: Volatility measure
- VaR: Risk measure

ANOMALY DETECTION:
- Sudden spikes: Market events, news impact
- Sharp drops: Market corrections, bad news
- Flat periods: Low activity, consolidation
- Consistent trends: Strong directional movement
- Erratic patterns: High volatility, uncertainty

VISUALIZATION BEST PRACTICES:
- Always check time range context
- Compare with benchmarks when available
- Look for patterns, not just individual points
- Consider multiple timeframes for full picture
- Hover over data points for exact values

COMMON QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
- "What does this chart show?" → Describe chart type, axes, data
- "Why is this trend happening?" → Analyze patterns, context
- "Is this normal?" → Compare with historical patterns
- "What should I do?" → Provide analytical insights (not advice)
